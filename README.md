# Oscar Nominee Watch Tracker
The main goal of this project is to track each year's Academy Awards nominees and whether they have been watched, as well as collate streaming & theatre data to make watching the nominees easier.

An eventual goal may include automatically adding nominee data automatically, via scraping, and perhaps maintaining an Oscars API.

In the meantime, though, data will be gathered manually to get to the interesting stuff - tracking watch data and enabling further watching.

## v1 sources
